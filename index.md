# CUCCLEN

This is a certified ``[I>`` project

CUCCLEN is a website where you can submit videos of music videos (primarily vocaloid, others accepted aswell) with subtitles edited made in English or any other language. The videos submitted, will then be available on the listing page (soon available.)

We made this website because we believed that YouTube's decision of disabling community-made subtitles was stupid. There were great custom made subtitles on Vocaloid songs like "aishite aishite aishite (love me love me love me) - Kikuo", "Koi no koi ni yoru koi no tame no koi (Love for Love by Love of Love) - PinocchioP" etc.

You can submit videos on the ["Issues" tab on GitHub.](https://github.com/Icycoide/cucclen/issues) (WITH THE "Video Submission" LABEL PLEASE!!!)

You can also suggest videos to be made by the CUCCLEN community on the ["Issues" tab on GitHub.](https://github.com/Icycoide/cucclen/issues) (USING THE "Suggestion" LABEL!)

Hope you enjoy the many contents that are to come!
